// Command Pattern

//The command pattern is a behavioral pattern that encapsulates information to perform an action into a command object. It involves three types:
//The invoker stores and executes commands.
// The command encapsulates the action as an object.
//The receiver is the object thatâ€™s acted upon by the command.

// Command pattern act like nsinvocation in Objective c

// When to use

// Mainly use for any Undo/Redo functionality in a program and store all of the actions in a history list and possibly to revert to earlier states by executing the stored actions in reverse order

//Use this pattern whenever you want to create actions that can be executed on receivers at a later point in time.

// The command pattern is also suitable for executing global command, such as sending user analytics
